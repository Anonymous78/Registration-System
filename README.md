# Registration-System
Creates a registration system that uses someone's face as their id. 
This project builds on the work done by victormungai97 whereby it adds a machine learning layer on top of his work.
This addition allows for the training of a classifier or a neural net on the uploaded images so that someone's face can then be recognised as being them.
